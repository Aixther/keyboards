<h1>Welcome to lAvaNya Keyboard</h1>

<p>
  This custom Telugu keyboard is inspired by Lekhini, a browser-based transliteration tool.
  It was created to overcome Lekhiniâ€™s limitation of working only within a browser.
  Most of the character mappings from Lekhini have been faithfully replicated, with a few exceptions.
  The layout was designed by Prashanth in 2025 to help his mother, who is already familiar with Lekhini.
