  <h1>Hindi Flick</h1>
  <p>
    <b>
      A mobile keyboard layout designed for Hindi, utilizing a flick input method.
    </b>
  </p>

  Barakunji is a mobile keyboard layout based upon the Devanagari varnamala's (alphabet) clustering of syllables. It is intended to be usable by anyone who knows the varnamala. 
  It is inspired by the flick-based layouts popular in Japan and (to a lesser extent) Korea, as well as Vietnamese TELEX with regards to diacritic rules and magic.
  <br><br>
  The layout is as follows:
  <br><br>
  <center>
    <img src="./layout.png" style="height: 75%; width: 75%;">
  </center>

  <br>
  There are 16 total keys, with 12 in the center being swipeable in multiple directions, longpress-able and multitap-able.

  <br><br>
